                <p class="text-left">About</p>
                <p class="font-weight-normal">The Brazil national football team (Portuguese: Seleção Brasileira de Futebol), nicknamed Seleção Canarinho, represents Brazil in men's international football and is administered by the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF), the governing body for football in Brazil. They have been a member of FIFA since 1923 and a member of CONMEBOL since 1916.

                    Brazil is the most successful national team in the FIFA World Cup, being crowned winner five times: 1958, 1962, 1970, 1994 and 2002. The Seleção also has the best overall performance in the World Cup competition, both in proportional and absolute terms, with a record of 73 victories in 109 matches played, 124 goal difference, 237 points, and 18 losses.[13][14] It is the only national team to have played in all World Cup editions without any absence nor need for playoffs,[15] and the only team to have won the World Cup on four different continents: once in Europe (1958 Sweden), once in South America (1962 Chile), twice in North America (1970 Mexico and 1994 United States), and once in Asia (2002 Korea/Japan). Brazil is also the most successful team in the now-defunct FIFA Confederations Cup, winning it four times, in 1997, 2005, 2009, and 2013.
                    
                    In relation to ranking standings Brazil fare well, having the highest average football Elo rating, and the fourth all-time peak football Elo rating, established in 1962.[16] In FIFA's ranking system Brazil holds the record for most Team of the Year first ranking wins with 12.[17] Many commentators, experts, and former players have considered the Brazil team of 1970 to be the greatest football team ever.[18][19][20][21][22] Other Brazilian teams are also highly estimated and regularly appear listed among the best teams of all time, such as the Brazil teams of 1958–62 and the squads of the 1994-02 period, with honorary mentions for the gifted 1982 side.[23][24][25][26] In 1996, the Brazilian national team achieved 35 consecutive matches undefeated, a feat which they held as a world record for 25 years.[27]
                    
                    Brazil has developed many rivalries through the years, with the most notable ones being with Argentina—known as the Superclássico das Américas in Portuguese,[28] Italy—known as the Clássico Mundial in Portuguese or the World Derby in English,[29][30] Uruguay due to the traumatic Maracanazo,[31] France due to the fact that they usually have difficulties against France in World Cups,[32] the Netherlands due to several important meetings between the two teams at World Cups, and the style of play of the two teams being considered similar,[33] and Portugal due to shared cultural traits and heritage, as well as the large number of Brazilian-born players in Portugal</p>
